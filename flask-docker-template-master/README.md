<p align = "justify">A simple <i>flask-template</i> for REST-API design and implementation. Template includes <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>.gitattributes</code> related to python and flask-api model. You can also update/change/delete <code>LICENSE</code> as required. Other files are related to <code>docker</code> and <code>flake8</code> (code linting) is included with basic setup. The template is built on GitHub, thus <code>.github</code> directory is included with issue template, and workflows directory.</p>

**NOTE:** some optional usage, specifications, and helpful links are as below:
  1. You can add GitHub Repository Badges from [Shields IO](https://shields.io/) - if this is a Public Repository;
  2. TAB (size = 4) has been used for indentation.
  3. `.github/workflows` is added however, it is recomended that you create your own workflows either using **GitHub Actions** or on your own.
  4. Basic `docker` files are added for convention, modify it as per requirement. Recomended to delete the file, if not required.
  5. The repository uses `markdown` instead of `rich text format`, so make necessary changes to file extension/type as required.
  6. [Engine Configuration](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html) for SQLAlchemy Documentation.
