# Sliding Window Problems

This folder contains standard sliding window problems with solutions in C++.

## What is Sliding Window?

Sliding window is a technique for solving problems involving arrays or strings by maintaining a subset (window) of elements and sliding it over the data structure efficiently.

## Problems Included

1. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**
   - Find the maximum sum of a subarray with size K.
   - Folder: `Max_Sum_Subarray/`

2. **Longest Substring with K Unique Characters**
   - Find the length of the longest substring with at most K unique characters.
   - Folder: `Longest_Substring_K_Unique/`

3. **Minimum Window Substring**
   - Find the smallest substring in a string containing all characters of another string.
   - Folder: `Min_Window_Substring/`

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the folder of the problem you want to run.
2. Compile the C++ code:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
