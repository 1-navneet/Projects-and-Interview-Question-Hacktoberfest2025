## React Fundamentals

### 1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. It was created by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and the community.

### 2. What are the main features of React?
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance
- **Component-based**: Applications are built using reusable components
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML syntax for writing components
- **Unidirectional data flow**: Data flows down from parent to child components
- **Declarative**: You describe what the UI should look like, not how to build it

### 3. What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It gets transpiled to regular JavaScript function calls.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```

### 4. What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation of the real DOM. React creates a virtual copy of the DOM in memory, makes changes to it, and then efficiently updates the real DOM only where changes occurred.

### 5. What is the difference between Element and Component?
- **Element**: A plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen
- **Component**: A function or class that returns React elements

### 6. What are React Components?
React components are independent, reusable pieces of UI. They can be functional components (functions) or class components (ES6 classes).

### 7. What is the difference between Functional and Class Components?

**Functional Component:**
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

**Class Component:**
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### 8. What are Props?
Props (properties) are read-only inputs to a React component. They are passed down from parent to child components and cannot be modified by the child component.

### 9. What is State?
State is a JavaScript object that stores component-specific data that may change over time. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be updated using `setState()`.

### 10. What is the difference between Props and State?
- **Props**: Immutable, passed from parent to child, read-only
- **State**: Mutable, internal to component, can be updated

### 11. What is the purpose of render() method?
The `render()` method is required in class components and returns the JSX that describes what should be rendered on the screen.

### 12. What is a controlled component?
A controlled component is an input form element whose value is controlled by React state. The component's value is set by props and changes are handled by event handlers.

```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  
  return (
    <input 
      value={value} 
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} 
    />
  );
}
```

### 13. What is an uncontrolled component?
An uncontrolled component is an input form element whose value is controlled by the DOM itself, not by React state.

```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  return <input defaultValue="Hello" />;
}
```

### 14. What is the key prop?
The `key` prop is a special attribute used to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed when rendering lists.

```jsx
{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
```

### 15. What is React.Fragment?
React.Fragment allows you to return multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node.

```jsx
function FragmentExample() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

### 16. What is the purpose of constructor in React?
The constructor is used to initialize state and bind event handlers in class components.

### 17. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?
- **React**: The core library for building components
- **ReactDOM**: The library for rendering React components to the DOM

### 18. What is the purpose of super() in constructor?
`super()` calls the parent class constructor and is required when extending React.Component.

### 19. What is the difference between React and Angular?
- **React**: Library, focuses on UI, uses JSX, unidirectional data flow
- **Angular**: Framework, full-featured, uses TypeScript, bidirectional data binding

### 20. What is the purpose of defaultProps?
`defaultProps` sets default values for props when they are not provided.

```jsx
Component.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Guest'
};
```

### 21. What is the purpose of PropTypes?
PropTypes provides runtime type checking for React props to catch bugs during development.

- **React**: Library, JSX, virtual DOM, unidirectional data flow
- **Vue**: Framework, template syntax, virtual DOM, bidirectional data binding

  );
}
