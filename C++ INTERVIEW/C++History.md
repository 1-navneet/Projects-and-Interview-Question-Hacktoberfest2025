C++ originated in 1979 when Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Labs sought to enhance the C language by introducing features inspired by Simula, an early object-oriented language.[1][3][6]

### Early Development (1979–1983)
While working on his Ph.D., Stroustrup found Simula’s object-oriented features powerful but its performance inadequate, and C’s efficiency valuable but low-level. To combine both strengths, he began developing “C with Classes” — a version of C that introduced object-oriented concepts like classes, inheritance, constructors, destructors, and access specifiers.[3][4][1]

Initially, this language was compiled using a preprocessor called *Cpre*, which translated “C with Classes” code into standard C code.  

### Birth of C++ (1983–1985)
In 1983, Rick Mascitti coined the name “C++,” symbolizing an “increment” (++) over the C language. The first major implementation replaced the preprocessor with a true compiler, *Cfront*, capable of generating C code after performing checks on syntax and semantics.[2][5][6][1]

That same year, features like virtual functions, operator overloading, references, type-safe memory handling, and the “const” keyword were introduced. In 1985, Stroustrup published **“The C++ Programming Language”**, making the language widely accessible and formalizing its usage.[6][3]

### Standardization and Evolution (1989–Present)
In 1989, C++ 2.0 introduced multiple inheritance, abstract classes, and static member functions. The ANSI C++ committee formed soon after, leading to the first standard in 1998 (ISO/IEC 14882:1998). Later updates—C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23—introduced major features such as auto type deduction, lambda expressions, smart pointers, modules, and coroutines.[3][6]

### Legacy
C++ has remained one of the most influential programming languages, balancing low-level performance with high-level abstractions. Its applications span from operating systems and game engines to finance, robotics, and embedded systems.[6]
