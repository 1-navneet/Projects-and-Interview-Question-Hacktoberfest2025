# Branch and Bound

Branch and Bound is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, as well as mathematical optimization. It is a systematic way of searching for an optimal solution by breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and eliminating those that are not promising.

The algorithm explores a tree of subproblems. The root of the tree represents the entire problem. Each node in the tree represents a subproblem. The children of a node are generated by "branching" on a decision variable.

The "bound" part of the name comes from the fact that we maintain a bound on the optimal solution. This bound is used to "prune" subproblems that are not promising. If the bound for a subproblem is worse than the current best solution, then we can prune that subproblem and all of its descendants.

The algorithm terminates when all subproblems have been either solved or pruned. The optimal solution is the best solution found so far.
