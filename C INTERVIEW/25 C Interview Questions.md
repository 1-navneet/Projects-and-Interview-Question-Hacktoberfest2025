## ✅ Core C Concepts

### 1. What are the key features of C?

It's a mid-level language (combining low-level and high-level features), procedural, portable, and has a rich set of library functions. It provides efficient memory management and is known for its speed.

### 2. What is the difference between a source code and an object code?

- **Source code:** Human-readable code written by the programmer (e.g., with a `.c` extension).
- **Object code:** Machine-readable binary code generated by the compiler (with a `.o` or `.obj` extension).

### 3. What are tokens in C?

Tokens are the smallest individual units of a program that are meaningful to the compiler.  
Examples include keywords, identifiers, constants, strings, and operators.

### 4. What is the purpose of `printf()` and `scanf()`?

- `printf()` is used to print formatted output to the console.
- `scanf()` is used to read formatted input from the keyboard.

### 5. What are the basic data types in C?

Basic data types include `int`, `char`, `float`, and `double`.

## ✅ Functions, Pointers & Memory Management

### 6. What is a function in C?

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize code, promote reusability, and make programs more modular.

### 7. What is a pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.  
They are fundamental to C for tasks like dynamic memory allocation and passing arguments by reference.

### 8. What is a dangling pointer?

A dangling pointer is a pointer that points to a memory location that has been deallocated or freed.  
Accessing a dangling pointer can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.

### 9. Explain the difference between call by value and call by reference.

- **Call by value:** A copy of the argument's value is
