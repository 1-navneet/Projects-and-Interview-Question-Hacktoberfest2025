# Question:

# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

# Note:

# A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Therefore, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.
# Input
# User Task
# As this is a functional problem, Your task here is to implement the function solveNQueens, which takes only an integer n as its argument, representing the size of the chessboard.


# Custom Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer n, representing the dimensions of the chessboard.
# Output
# Return an array of array of strings representing all the possible ways to place the n Queens on the chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

# Custom Output
# Print the whole combinations of n x n chess board (sorted-manner), where queens are placed without attacking each other, where combinations are separated via separator.
# Constraints
# 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 9

# Explanation:
# There exist two distinct solutions to the 4 queens puzzle as shown above

#Solution:

def solveNQueens(n):
    board = [["." for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    result = []

    def isSafe(row, col):
        # Check column above
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i][col] == "Q":
                return False
        # Check upper-left diagonal
        i, j = row, col
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if board[i][j] == "Q":
                return False
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        # Check upper-right diagonal
        i, j = row, col
        while i >= 0 and j < n:
            if board[i][j] == "Q":
                return False
            i -= 1
            j += 1
        return True

    def backtrack(row):
        if row == n:
            result.append(["".join(r) for r in board])
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if isSafe(row, col):
                board[row][col] = "Q"
                backtrack(row + 1)
                board[row][col] = "."  # backtrack

    backtrack(0)
    return result
