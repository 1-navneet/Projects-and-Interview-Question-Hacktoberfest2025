Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)

Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations

Recursive and Iterative Tree Algorithms

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

Height, Depth & Diameter Calculations

Tree Transformations & Mirror Trees

Path and Sum Problems

Serialization & Deserialization

Advanced Logic Building using DFS/BFS
