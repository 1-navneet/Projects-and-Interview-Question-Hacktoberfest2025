# Array Programs in C++

This folder contains basic and commonly used array operations implemented in C++.
Each program demonstrates a fundamental concept of arrays such as searching, rotation, and manipulation.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

### 1. `01_basic_array_operations.cpp`
- Finds the **largest** and **smallest** elements in an array.
- Reverses the array without using extra space.

### 2. `02_array_rotation.cpp`
- Rotates an array **to the left** or **to the right** by a given number of positions.
- Uses the efficient **reversal algorithm**.

### 3. `03_searching_algorithm.cpp`
- Implements **Linear Search** (`O(n)`) and **Binary Search** (`O(log n)`).
